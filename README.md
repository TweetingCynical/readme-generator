## About the Project

### Deployment / Code Repository

[Live Deployment](https://TweetingCynical.github.io/readme-generator/)

[Repository](https://github.com/TweetingCynical/readme-generator)

[Video Walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17XvcqDKRhH-g58sJVA9bk-Litg_0h0pE/view)
NOTE: This video walkthrough talks through the added extras I created in this project, and also how I found solutions to some of the problems I faced. If you wish to skip this part of the walkthrough, and go straight the demonstration of my app, this can be found at the 14:45 mark of the video.

### Screenshot

Working version of the app should look like this:
<img src="./assets/screenshot.png" alt="Working version of project" style="max-width: 800px;">

### Scope and Purpose

Build an interactive command line app which collects details from a user in order to build a personalised README file. The user should be able to make some choices over whether to include some of the elememts, and also be able to control whether or not there are multiple lines used in some of the answers. The app will automatically generate the content, and store it as a named file within the generated-files folder of the repo.

### Usage

This site and its contents are for educational purposes only. You should have Node.js installed to be able to run this program.
